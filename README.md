## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- Evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- This dataset has different number of images in each category of cancer.
- Use augmentation techinique to generate more training data which can be used for model building.
- When enough augmented data is used, this helps to solve the overfitting issue and get the good test and training accuracy.
